[How to do research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fWNPS5Ts2s13T3GFQIo_6H2LEOT1ZVHy-Pu_tDHHp_A/edit#slide=id.p) is a educational slides project that contains **practical and actionable** experience about how to do research (including reading, writing and presenting papers). 

This slides originate from Hang Liu when he was a PhD student. He actively maintains and updates this slides through his own experience. Now, a considerable number of students, both native and international, find the slides to be constructive! 

After a discussion with Dr. Chunhua Liao at ACM FCRC '19, Hang Liu decided to *open source* the slides, hoping them would benefit the public at large.

Please enjoy the materials and your feedbacks are always welcome!
